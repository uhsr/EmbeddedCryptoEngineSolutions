# EmbeddedCryptoEngineSolutions

## Description

A Rust-based cryptocurrency library implementing zk-SNARKs for privacy-preserving transactions and a novel directed acyclic graph (DAG) for consensus, enabling high throughput and resistance to front-running attacks.

## Features

- Implements AES-GCM encryption with hardware acceleration for high-throughput data protection.
- Integrates a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) based on physical entropy sources for cryptographic key generation.
- Verifies firmware integrity using a secure bootloader with authenticated updates via a dedicated hardware security module (HSM).
- Supports Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) over NIST P-256 and Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) over Curve25519.
- Provides secure key storage using a tamper-resistant memory region with access control policies.
- Offers a modular architecture that allows for the integration of custom cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
- Implements side-channel attack countermeasures, including timing attack resistance and power analysis mitigation.
- Generates and manages cryptographic keys using a Key Management System (KMS) compliant with PKCS#11 standard.
