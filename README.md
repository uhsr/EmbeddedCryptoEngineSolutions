# EmbeddedCryptoEngineSolutions

## Description



## Features

- Integrate a hardware security module (HSM) for secure key storage and cryptographic operations.
- Implement AES-GCM encryption for secure over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates.
- Utilize a true random number generator (TRNG) for cryptographic key generation.
- Support secure boot with verified boot chain using digital signatures.
- Provide secure communication channels using TLS 1.3 with mutual authentication.
- Implement side-channel attack resistance through constant-time cryptographic algorithms.
- Integrate a secure element (SE) for tamper-proof storage of sensitive data and cryptographic keys.
- Support Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with Curve25519 for key exchange and digital signatures.
